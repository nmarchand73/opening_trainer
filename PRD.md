- **UI/UX Libraries**: 
  - **shadcn/ui** for beautiful, accessible components
  - **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
  - **Lucide React** for consistent icons
  - **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication

### Backend Stack (Python)
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async API
- **Chess Engine**: 
  - `python-chess` for move validation and position analysis
  - `stockfish` Python wrapper for engine integration
- **AI Assistant**: Ollama integration via HTTP requests
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **WebSocket**: FastAPI WebSocket support for real-time updates

### Development Tools
- **Frontend**: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest for testing
- **Backend**: Black for formatting, pytest for testing, mypy for type checking
- **Package Managers**: npm (frontend), pip/poetry (backend)

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Chess Interface
- Responsive chessboard component with drag-and-drop moves

- Move history navigation with undo/redo functionality
- Visual highlighting for last moves and candidate moves

### 2. Opening System Modules
Each system (Stonewall, Torre, Colle) includes:
- Formation diagrams with annotated explanations
- Strategic plans and typical piece placements  
- Common transpositions and move order flexibility
- Master game examples with analysis

### 3. AI Learning Assistant
- Real-time position analysis and move explanations
- Natural language Q&A about opening principles
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance
- Pattern recognition for tactical motifs

### 4. Analysis Engine
- Position evaluation with numerical scores
- Best move suggestions with engine lines
- Variation tree exploration
- Move quality assessment with explanations

### 5. Training System
- Progressive lesson structure with checkpoints
- Interactive exercises with immediate feedback
- Timed challenges and puzzle solving
- Performance analytics and progress tracking
